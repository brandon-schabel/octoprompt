## What is Promptliano?

Promptliano is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that gives AI assistants deep understanding of your codebase. It provides intelligent context management, reducing token usage by 60-70% while improving code generation accuracy. Works seamlessly with Claude Desktop, Cursor, VSCode, and other MCP-compatible editors.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: CLI Setup (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started with Promptliano is using our CLI tool:

```bash
npx promptliano@latest
```

This will:

- Download and install the Promptliano server
- Configure MCP for your AI editor (Claude, Cursor, etc.)
- Start the server automatically
- Guide you through creating your first project

> **Note:** Using `@latest` ensures you always run the most recent version. No installation required!

## Running Binaries

### Running on Linux

On Linux you should be able to just navigate to the promptliano binary file in the terminal and run it for example:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/promptliano-v0.9.2
```

Run the linux binary file:

```bash
./promptliano
```

### Running on MacOS

Currently I don't have MacOS code signing, so it just says the binary is damaged, but really it is quarntined. In order to run the binary on Mac you would have to do the following

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/promptliano-v0.9.2
```

Then run to remove the quarantine:

```bash
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine ./promptliano
```

Finally you can run the Promptliano app by running the binary file as you normally would

```bash
./promptliano
```

### Running on Windows

After downloading and extracting the appropriate zip file (e.g., `promptliano-v0.9.2-windows-x64.zip`), open Command Prompt or PowerShell.

Navigate to the extracted folder. For example, if you extracted it to your Downloads folder:

```batch
cd %USERPROFILE%\Downloads\promptliano-v0.9.2-windows-x64
```

Or using PowerShell:

```powershell
cd $env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\promptliano-v0.9.2-windows-x64
```

Then, run the executable:

```batch
.\promptliano.exe
```
